# Release-notes-from-changelog

Release-notes-from-changelog is a GitHub action for extracting release notes from a changelog formatted according to https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.

For this action to work you need a file in your repository called `RELEASE_HEAD.md` that contains any header text that you want to add to all your releases.
This can be, for example, a short sentence explaining the general purpose of the project, or simply a note that the following text was extracted from a changelog.

It can be used as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: "My fancy build"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: CSchoel/release-notes-from-changelog@v1
      - uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body_path: RELEASE.md # generated by release-notes-from-changelog
          draft: true
```
