# Release-notes-from-changelog

Release-notes-from-changelog is a GitHub action for extracting release notes from a changelog formatted according to https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/.

For this action to work you need a file in your repository called `RELEASE_HEAD.md` that contains any header text that you want to add to all your releases.
This can be, for example, a short sentence explaining the general purpose of the project, or simply a note that the following text was extracted from a changelog.

It can be used as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: "My fancy build"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: CSchoel/release-notes-from-changelog@v1
      - uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body_path: RELEASE.md # generated by release-notes-from-changelog
          draft: true
```

## Input variables

```yaml
- uses: CSchoel/release-notes-from-changelog@v1
  with:
    version: version string to search in the changelog
    begin-pattern: begin pattern used in sed command (default '/^## \\[${RELEASE_VERSION}\\]/')
    end-pattern: end pattern used in sed command (default '/^## /')
    chop: number of lines to cut from end of matched region
```

## Known issues

The default settings do not work for the very first version in the changelog, as we use `^## ` as the end pattern, which will not be found by sed.
To circumvent this, you can do one of the following:

* Add a dummy level 2 heading at the end of your changelog for the first release. Starting from the second release, you can safely remove it.
* Set the `end-pattern` to `$` and `chop` to `0`. You *have* to change this for future versions, of course. An example for this can be seen in the [test workflow](.github/workflows/test.yml) for this project.
* Make the first entry in the changelog a pre-release that will not actually be release, but still look sensible in the changelog.
