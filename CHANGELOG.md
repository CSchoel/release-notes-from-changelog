### Fixed

nothing

## [1.2.0] - 2022-01-10

### Added

* Test case for missing URL for footnote-style markdown link in CHANGELOG.md

### Changed

* Split main script into multiple steps and added more output for better debugging.
* Final `grep` step is now only run if the link pattern can actually be found in the changelog.
    If not, a warning is printed.
* Switches to `uses: ./` to use local version of action in all CI/CD scripts.
    This avoids the need to specify the action version within the CI/CD scripts and ensures that the current version is used.
* Uses [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create) instead of [unmaintained `actions/create-release`](https://github.com/actions/create-release) both in README example and release script.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed
